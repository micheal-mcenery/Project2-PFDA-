This dataset is comprised of 569 instances of features computed from digitized images of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Each instance describes characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. More information can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic).\n",
